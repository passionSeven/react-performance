# 01 - useMemo for expensive calculations

## Background

React hooks are amazing. Being able to put all the logic and state management
within a function component (the "render method" equivalent for a class) allows
for mind blowing composability.

This power comes with an unfortunate limitation that calculations performed
within render will be performed every single render, regardless of whether the
inputs for the calculations change. For example:

```jsx
function Distance({x, y}) {
  const distance = calculateDistance(x, y)
  return (
    <div>
      The distance between {x} and {y} is {distance}.
    </div>
  )
}
```

If that component's parent re-renders, or if we add some unrelated state to the
component and trigger a re-render, we'll be calling `calculateDistance` every
render which could lead to a performance bottleneck.

This is why we have the `useMemo` hook from React:

```jsx
function Distance({x, y}) {
  const distance = React.useMemo(() => calculateDistance(x, y), [x, y])
  return (
    <div>
      The distance between {x} and {y} is {distance}.
    </div>
  )
}
```

This allows us to put that calculation behind a function which is only called
when the result actually needs to be re-evaluated (when the dependencies
change). In the example above the array `[x, y]` are called "dependencies" and
React knows that so long as those do not change, the result of our function will
be the same as the last time the function was called.

## Exercise

We have a `Menu` component that's calling a `getItems` function every render.
This function is really slow because it's attempting to sort thousands of items
based on the user's filter input.

Your job is to improve performance by wrapping `getItems` in `React.useMemo`.

To observe the performance problem with `getItems`, open the Chrome DevTools
"Performance" tab, click the settings gear and set CPU from "no throttling" to
"6x slowdown." Then select any item from the dropdown. Next, click the "Record"
circle icon in the devtools to start a recording. Then click on "force rerender"
and then click the "Record" circle again to stop the recording. You'll notice
that `getItems` was called when it should not have been (and it took a LONG time
to run). Your goal is to make it so `getItems` is only called when the filter
changes.
