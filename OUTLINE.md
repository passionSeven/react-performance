## Overview

The secret to performance is this: Less code.

1. Load less code
2. Run less code

All of the performance optimization techniques that you learn in this workshop
will be doing one of those two things.

The tools we'll be using are to help you determine where these problems exist
and what you can do to best optimize those things.

> NOTE: I know that you're eager to get into the React DevTools profiler. It's
> awesome. I promise we'll get to it, but the first few exercises we'll be using
> the regular browser devtools. You'll use them both together, don't worry!
> Patience is a virtue 😉
